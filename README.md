### Hi there!
### My name is Umang, welcome to my GitHub!

I'm a former software developer who has pivoted to cybersecurity. I'm currently working as a Cyber Security Analyst, and I absolutely love the field! But I miss writing code, building things, creating innovative solutions, and even spending hours debugging (just a little, not too much!).

To reconnect with the engineering side of things, I'm building projects I enjoy and developing tools I personally use.

#### üî≠ Long-Term Goals
My goal is to move into security architecture roles, where I can design and implement security solutions for organisations. I'm hoping that the projects I‚Äôm working on now will help me transition into engineering-focused roles and, eventually, into security architecture.

#### üìö What I'm Learning
- Currently diving into **C++** because I'm interested in systems programming and securing low-level applications. I‚Äôm fascinated by how operating systems, databases, and networks function under the hood, and I'm interested in building tech that powers things from cloud infrastructure to embedded systems.
- Comfortable coding in **Python**, with 3+ years of experience in developing web applications, automation, scripting, and working with cloud technologies.

#### ü§ù Collaboration
I'm always looking for opportunities to collaborate with people on exciting projects. So, if you're working on something you're truly excited about, I encourage you to reach out!
